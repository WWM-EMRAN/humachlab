        <h2><i class="bx bx-user"></i> About</h2>
				<p>
					This is Emran.
					I wish to cherish and enjoy every moment of my existence.
					I really like nature and anything that is simple.
					I am a friendly and travel maniac individual.<br>

					I am very enthusiastic about learning new things, especially those that I like.
					I was intrigued by the first lecture about Machine Learning explaining how humans and machines learn from the environment in the same way.
					Exploring Machine Learning has become my passion since then and a part of my profession since my early career.<br>

					I earned a 4-year Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at
					Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science and Technology University (HSTU), Bangladesh with a year of partial research involvement.
					My research focused on searching algorithm enhancement.
					I also did project works during this period.
					I was also involved in various activities including voluntary work, tech event management, and participation in computer programming contests.<br>

					After my graduation, I worked in software development industries in my home country for almost 3 years and
					developed many iOS apps independently as well as in a group.
					I started my career at Kento Studios Ltd. then moving to DROID Bangladesh (DROIDBD) Ltd. and finally at Advanced Apps Bangladesh (AAPBD) Ltd.
					I focused on software development strategies, automation and industry management skills.
					Within this period, I had been promoted to senior software engineer and software development manager.
					I also received the best employee award for the recognition of my devotion and hard work. <br>

					Later, I worked as an academician and a faculty member under the department of CSE at HSTU, where I have been working there for over 8 years.
					I conducted variety of major courses in CSE and was also involved in research works, projects and research supervision.
					I taught different courses including the major courses- computer programming languages: C, C++, Java, PHP, C#;
					web technologies: HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL;
					database systems: Database Systems, Oracle, MySQL; smartphone app development; data science: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning,
					Pattern Recognition; Computer hardware.<br>

					I had been awarded a fellowship from the Ministry of Science and Technology, the People’s Republic of Bangladesh,
					for higher studies in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) areas.
					Then I finished my 2-year Master of Science (M.Sc.) degree by research in Information Technology (IT) from Deakin University, Australia.
					It was a complete research-based program offered by the School of IT (SIT) at the Melbourne Burwood campus.

					My research during master's was mainly based the application of machine learning and optimisation in physiological signal (biosignal) processing and disease detection.
					To be specific Brain signal (Electroencephalograms-EEG) analysis and apply machine learning method for
					epileptic seizure disease/disorder detection.
					In these two years, I have been able to publish a few research articles along with a feature extractor library in
					Python language which will soon be available for the research community.<br>

					I had also worked as a research assistant on several research projects.
					A voluntary project initiation from Deakin University in collaboration with Monash University and Alfred Health for
					detecting/predicting epileptic seizures automatically in ICU patients, and detection of minimising the EEG channel to observe.
					In another project in collaboration with Monash University and AETMOS Australia (Air quality monitoring and healthy environment solution provider),
					I worked on indoor air temperature prediction for air quality forecasting and observed the relationship between
					indoor air temperature with health concerns.<br>

					I have been offered a Cotutelle (join) Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) program at Deakin University, Australia
					in collaboration with Coventry University, United Kingdom.
					This type of program is conducted by all the collaborating universities and under the supervision of faculty members from all the participating universities.
					I will be doing my research on finding the relationship between sleep and sleep stages, with (healthy) aging.
					I am intended to use interpretable ML models in this project.
					This will be another ML application based project that will use physiological signals.<br>

					I have good management, leadership, and technical skills with expertise in programming and data analytics which I achieved from my practices and experiences.
					I am looking forward to utilising my research knowledge and development skills to come up with industry-grade products or services that will contribute to shaping a better future.
